        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This salmon linguine is a custom dish prepared by Ashlee as an easier home-made version of her esteemed seafood linguine.</p>
        <p>There is a small amount of prep-work required, but it's realistically something you could make on a weeknight.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Salmon Fillets (Medium-Sized)</li>
            <li>Linguine Pasta (250g)</li>
            <li>Garlic Butter (30g)</li>
            <li>Frozen Spinach (30g)</li>
            <li>Salt, Olive oil </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin boiling water for pasta.</li>
            <li>Chop up all salmon fillets into ideally equal bite-size chunks, keeping the skin on.</li>
            <li>Begin cooking linguine pasta in pot with boiling water, adding salt and olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Ensure movement of pasta in water to allow for even cooking.</li>
            <li>Begin frying up salmon in a frypan with some olive oil and salt well.</li>
            <li>Continue frying up salmon until a good crust has formed. Ensure skin is crisp.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta water and then add cooked pasta into the salmon pan with garlic butter.</li>
            <li>As butter begins to melt add in frozen spinach, mix, and continue to cook until spinach thaws.</li>
            <li>Serve up portions into a suitable plate or bowl.</li>
        </ol>

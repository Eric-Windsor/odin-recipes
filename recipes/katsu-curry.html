        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Katsu Curry is a Japanese dish that consists of breaded chicken, rice and a curry sauce made out of vegetables and katsu sauce.</p>
        <p>There is a moderate amount of prep-work required, but if you're in a pinch consider cooking the chicken in the oven instead of frying. This dish should comfortably serve 3 or 4 people.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Chicken Breasts (Medium-Sized)</li>
            <li>3 Carrots (Medium-Sized)</li>
            <li>4 Yellow Potatoes (Medium-Sized)</li>
            <li>Rice (1.5 cups, uncooked)</li>
            <li>3 whole eggs</li>
            <li>Flour (12 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>Panko Breadcrumbs (12 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>3 Katsu Curry stock cubes</li>
            <li>Salt, Pepper, Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin boiling water for vegetables.</li>
            <li>Wash rice in rice cooker and then start rice cooker with appropriate amount of water.</li>
            <li>Cut carrots and potatoes into a medium-large dice of approximately equal size.</li>
            <li>Boil all vegetables with water in a pot until they have become more tender, but not soft. Add a pinch of salt to the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Prepare breading station by beating eggs in a bowl, placing mixture of flour, a pinch of salt and a crack of pepper on a plate and placing Panko breadcrumbs on a second plate.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken breast in half to create a larger flat surface area to use for the dish. A flatter shape will prevent chicken being undercooked while being fried.</li>
            <li>Dry the flat chicken breasts in flour, then submerge in the egg wash before finally coating them in breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Shallow fry the breaded chicken in olive oil in a frypan. Continue frying until chicken is crisp and golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the chicken fries, drain out 95% of the vegetable water and stir in 2 of the curry stock cubes.</li>
            <li>Stir curry and vegetable mixture well until sauce reaches appropriate consistency - it should be viscous but not thick. Add water and the final stock cube as appropriate to reach this consistency.</li>
            <li>Slice up fried chicken breast in the style of your choosing to make consumption easier.</li>
            <li>Arrange breaded chicken, rice and curry sauce on a plate and then serve.</li>
        </ol>

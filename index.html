        <p>Below is a collection of recipes that each have a personal interest to me for a different reason.</p>

        <p>The first - the Shepherd's pie - my personal favourite recipe that I've enjoyed since childhood. The second - the katsu curry - a newer favourite that I was introduced to in adulthood. The final one - the salmon linguine - one that I was introduced to by my partner's homecooking. Here they are for your perusal:</p>
